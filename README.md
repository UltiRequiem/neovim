# UltiVim

A Neovim configuration using sane defaults native LSP and snippets.

If you are using Vim and not Neovim, although I really don't know why,
you may be interested in my [ftplugin](./ftplugin).Everything else is written in Lua.

The configuration of my whole system is [here](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/dotfiles).
