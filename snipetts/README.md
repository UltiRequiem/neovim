# Snippets

Textmate snippets are compatible with the normal vscode Snippets so its very easy to get cool snippets,
but they don't have as many options as UltiSnippets. Also Textmate snippets are stored in jsons, which is pretty cool.
So I will try to use them whenever I can unless I need something very specific, as in [all.snippets](./ultisnippets/all.snippets)
