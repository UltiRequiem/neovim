# UltiVim

A Neovim configuration using sane defaults, native LSP and snippets.

If you are using Vim instead of Neovim, although I really don't know why,
you may be interested in my [ftplugin](./ftplugin).Everything else is written in Lua.

The configuration of my whole system is [here](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/dotfiles).

If you find any errors or have any suggestions, it would be great if you do a pull request or an [issue](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/UltiVim/issues/new)!

## Other configurations
[LunarVim](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim): It helped me a lot to configure the LSP
[Kuator](https://github.com/kuator/nvim): A lot of cool stuff
[Elianiva](https://github.com/elianiva/dotfiles/tree/master/nvim)

If you think your configuration is cool, make a pull request and include it!
